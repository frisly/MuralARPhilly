                      Letter from the Future, Where We All Are Safe<br>


                      Mural Arts Class Collective Poem<br><br>




                      I wish you could see this. I’m writing to you from the future. <br>


                      I know life isn’t all sunshine but if you pull through you will be amazing. 


                      We survived.


                      I thought about how my parents taught me how to stay safe. 


                      My mom and dad are older now, it was now my responsibility to keep them safe. 


                      We learned to find safety in our own body when nothing else will protect us.


                      There was permission to be vulnerable with your darkest truths


                      They stopped putting minorities under scrutiny.


                      There was a cure to all diseases 


                      There was mutual care for eachothers wellbeing 


                      There was ’The Ramen Gang’’ : a group of people who understand the look of pain in someone's eyes. 


                      People shutdown the government. And made their own


                      No countries 


                      No Gender Binaries


                      No Borders 


                      Here, The Unfamiliar is not seen as dangerous


                      A digital library 


                      All known as Earth 


                      No one is afraid to express 


                      People relaxing on their open balconies 


                      We celebrated the melanin we were blessed with


                      We stopped hiding behind the mask and start showing our true selves


                      There is no longer one president but a group of 6 leaders 



                      The police as you know it is a thing of the past


                      People in power are diverse in gender identity, age, race, ability and age. 


                      They work to reform our communities not rip them apart


                      and solved problems at the root of the source 


                      Black Girls stitched up a loose thread of the fabric that is life


                      nana’s and momma’s boisterous laughs fill my craving ears 


                      Those I hold most dear are right by my side 


                      The smell of salt in the ocean air 


                      Self love is at an all time high


                      The coming years for you will be hard


                      But the future is worth the fight. 


                      Just hold on and you will see.

                  <p>Our mural is located on the unceded territories of the Lenni Lenape people. 
                    The sacred plants depicted in this mural; tobacco and sweetgrass are native to these lands. 
                    We acknowledge with respect the Lenape peoples' historic and enduring relationship with Lenapehoking, where Philadelphia sits. 
                    Our vision of safety for Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian and POC communities is interconnected with Indigenous flourishing and self-determination. 
                    We stand with Indigenous peoples all over Turtle Island and the islands of the Pacific who are exercising their sovereignty and working toward justice and freedom. </p>

                  <br>Through examining art, meditation, songs and writings from Black, Indigenous, Latinx and Asian American artists, cultural workers and storytellers, this introductory course works with highschool-aged youth to contextualize and critically think about the issues of our present day, and use art to open a portal into the future we dream. 
                    By bringing in visiting artists and leading discussions and art and writing workshops we create a space for local youth to write, make art, and dream. 
                    Together we will create the foundations of a permanent mural in Philadelphia that shows a collective future where we keep each other safe.
